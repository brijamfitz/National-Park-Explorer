The National Park Explorer is a React app that allows you to view each state's National Park sites.

The app was bootstrapped with the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) toolchain.

It consumes the official [National Park Service API](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/get-started.htm).

The interactive map is a wonderful `npm` addition from [react-usa-map](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-usa-map).

The UI utilizes several [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) components.
